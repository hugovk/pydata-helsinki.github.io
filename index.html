    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        This meetup is for those who work or aspire to work in fields like
        machine learning, data engineering, MLOps, visualization, and statistical modeling.
        We share real-world experiences about solving problems in these fields using open-source tools,
        including but not limited to Python and its libraries – users of R, Julia or other languages are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        We welcome speakers to talk about these tools and experiences using them, regardless of the level (beginner, intermediate, advanced are welcome).
        The usual talk is about half an hour long, but lightning talks of 5–10 minutes are great too!
        Occasionally we will include a debate! Come with a thought-provoking question or a hot take,
        and we'll set up a discussion where everyone can take part.
